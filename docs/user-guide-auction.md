### 2. Enter Auction Details
- Click "Create Auction" to open the auction form.
- Fill in the following required fields:
  - **Volume**: Enter the number of ACCUs you need (e.g., 10,000 ACCUs).
  - **Max Price**: Specify your maximum price per tonne in AUD (e.g., $25/ton).
  - **Vintage Preference** (optional): Select preferred vintage years if you have specific requirements (e.g., 2020-2023).
- Review your entries for accuracy before proceeding.

### 3. Post the Auction
- Click "Post Auction" to submit your auction to the platform.
- The system will automatically list your auction for eligible sellers to view and bid on.

### 4. Monitor for Matches
- Once a seller matches your auction criteria, you'll receive an email notification with details such as:
  - Auction ID (e.g., "Auction #123 matched at $25/ton â€” please confirm").
- Log back into the platform to review the match details.

### 5. Confirm the Auction
- In the platform, click "Confirm" to approve the match.
- Upon confirmation:
  - The system locks the ACCUs in escrow.
  - The seller initiates the transfer of ACCUs through the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units (ANREU).

### 6. Complete the Transfer
- After the ANREU transfer is processed, download the CER (Carbon Emission Reduction) surrender form directly from the platform.
- Submit the form to ANREU to finalize your ACCU acquisition and meet compliance requirements.

## Compliance Notes
- **Sufficient Holdings Required**: You must hold sufficient ACCUs in your ANREU account to cover the auction volume. Ensure your account balance meets or exceeds the auctioned amount before posting.
- **Binding Agreements**: All auctions on CarbonX are legally binding. Double-check your maximum price to ensure it aligns with your budget and compliance needs.
